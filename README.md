## Reproducibility

All scripts in this repository are deterministic given the same input data and
software environment.

To reproduce the workflows:
1. Obtain the required input datasets listed in the **Data Availability**
   section.
2. Ensure directory paths in the scripts are updated to match your local or
   system environment.
3. Run the storm selection workflow prior to downstream hydrodynamic analyses.
4. Run the synthetic TC processing workflow to generate model-ready NetCDF
   forcing files.

No random number generation or stochastic parameterization is performed within
this repository.

## Data Availability

Due to data volume and licensing constraints, **input datasets are not included
in this repository**.

### External Data Sources

- **NCEP Reanalysis Tropical Cyclone Tracks**  
  Publicly available from NOAA-affiliated data portals.

- **ADCIRC Storm Tide Simulations**  
  Generated using licensed or institution-specific ADCIRC configurations.
  Availability may depend on institutional access.

- **CMIP6 Synthetic Tropical Cyclones (SSP5-8.5)**  
  Derived from CMIP6 climate model output. Access may require:
  - Registration with ESGF nodes
  - Institutional storage resources

Processed NetCDF outputs generated by these workflows may be shared subject to
the terms of the original data providers.
