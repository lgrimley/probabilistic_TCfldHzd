# Synthetic TC Tracks 
The scripts in this folder are used for analyzing the TC track MAT-files generated by the MIT Model. Key workflows include:
1. Spatially subsetting TC tracks and extracting the track charactersitics (described below)
2. Bias-correction of TC intensity distribution (described in `gcm_bias_correction` folder)
3. Subsetting TC tracks by weighted sampling from the TC intensity distriubtion (described in `gcm_bias_correction` folder)

## Inputs
1. TC track MAT-files with variables `lat100`, `lon100`, `vstore100`, `pstore100`, `rmw100`, `ro100`, `uinc100`, `vinc100`
2. Geospatial data for selecting tracks such as points (i.e., ADCIRC Stormtide Locations) or polygons (i.e., SFINCS model domain, study area)

## Spatially subsetting TC tracks and extracting the track charactersitics
These scripts return the TC characteristics near landfall and the extracted information is used in downstream analysis.
### Scripts
- **tracks_select_by_point.py** and **tracks_select_by_polygon.py**
  - Usage: selecting the TC tracks that come within a distance of a point or intersect with a polygon
  - Input:
     - point or polygon shapefile
     - track files (.mat)
  - Output:
     - list of TC IDS corresponding to the track files that intersect input geometry (buffered point or polygon)
- **calculate_landfall_vmax.py**
  - Usage: this script returns the max wind speeds at landfall for the select TCs
  - Input:
     - track files (.mat)
     - list of TC IDs (i.e., generated from scripts above)
  - Output:
     - table of landfall vmax for each TC ID
- **tc_track_info_to_table.py**
  - Usage: this script returns all of the variable stored in the TC track files for the select TC IDs at landfall
  - Input:
     - track files (.mat)
     - list of TC IDs (i.e., generated from scripts above)
  - Output:
     - table of all TC track variables for each TC ID
- **storm_durations_table.py**
  - Usage: this script estimates the duration of the TC over the model domain to estimate approximately how long the SFINCS model runs would be to estimate simulation time.
  - Input:
     - track files (.mat)
     - list of TC IDs (i.e., generated from scripts above)
